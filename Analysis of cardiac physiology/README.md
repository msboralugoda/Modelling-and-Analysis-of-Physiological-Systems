# Cardiac Physiology Simulation using CircAdapt

This project explores the dynamic mechanical and hemodynamic behavior of the heart using the CircAdapt simulation software. It covers both normal cardiac function and pathological changes during aortic valve stenosis.

## 🧠 Concepts Explored

- **Wiggers Diagram Analysis**: Studied the temporal relationships between electrical and mechanical events of the cardiac cycle.
- **Valve Dynamics**: Identified opening and closing moments of the mitral and aortic valves using pressure and volume signals.
- **Pressure-Volume Loops**: Analyzed phases of the cardiac cycle and their relation to cardiac performance and workload.
- **E/A Ratio**: Interpreted mitral valve flow patterns to assess diastolic function.
- **Hemodynamic Effects of Aortic Stenosis**: Simulated progressive aortic valve narrowing and analyzed changes in pressure, volume, and pump work.
- **Simplified Bernoulli Equation**: Applied to estimate pressure drop across stenotic valves from velocity data.

## 🔬 Key Insights Gained

- Under normal physiology, the mitral valve shows distinct E- and A-waves corresponding to passive and active ventricular filling, respectively.
- The pressure-volume relationship reveals four distinct phases: isovolumic contraction, ejection, isovolumic relaxation, and filling.
- In aortic valve stenosis, afterload on the left ventricle increases significantly, requiring more pump work to maintain cardiac output.
- Hypertrophic adaptation of the myocardium is a compensatory mechanism to sustain function under elevated afterload, though it may further increase ventricular stiffness.
- The E/A ratio provides a non-invasive measure of diastolic function; a ratio >1 generally indicates healthy filling dynamics.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **CircAdapt v1.1.0**: For simulating cardiovascular dynamics.
- **Graphical Analysis**: Used built-in tools for identifying valve transitions, flow velocities, and area estimation.
