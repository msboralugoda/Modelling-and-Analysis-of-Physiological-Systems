# Branched Cylinders: Dendritic Tree Approximations

This project models the passive electrical properties of a simplified dendritic tree using branched cable theory. The model consists of a parent branch and two daughter branches, with the aim of studying how voltage propagates and distributes under various structural and boundary conditions.

## 🧠 Key Concepts Explored

- **Cable Theory**: Used to model neurons as cylindrical cables for analyzing voltage spread in dendritic and axonal structures.
- **Electrotonic Distance**: Normalization of physical length to account for spatial decay of voltage in biological tissues.
- **Steady-State Solutions**: Derived the general form of voltage distribution using exponential functions based on differential equations.
- **Matrix Method**: Formulated a 6x6 linear system representing boundary and nodal conditions to solve for voltage coefficients.
- **Voltage Profiles**: Investigated the effects of different terminal conditions and geometric properties (like branch diameters) on voltage attenuation and distribution.

## 📈 What I Learned

Working on this model helped me understand:

- How boundary and continuity conditions shape the overall behavior of electrical signals in branched biological systems.
- The importance of branch diameter in controlling voltage drop and signal propagation.
- How to apply MATLAB for matrix algebra and visualizations in physiological modeling.
- How structural symmetries (e.g., equal branch diameters) influence voltage uniformity in dendritic trees.
- How simple changes to system inputs or conditions (e.g., killed vs active ends) lead to significantly different outcomes in voltage distribution.
